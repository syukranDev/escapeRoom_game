In this project, an escape room game is programmed on NUVOTON NUC140VE3CN using C languages.
Escape room is a game where a boy trapped in room and he required to collect all the key for unlock the locks to escape and win the game. 
There are several key features that we have implemented into our embedded system which are 3x3 Keypad, LED light, Buzzer, 7 Segment Display, LCD Display and Timer for interrupt purposes.
